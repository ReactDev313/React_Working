  intro: `I'm a veteran web engineer who knows what he is doing.
  Once you have a contract with me, you might don't need to seek another developer.
I am different from other freelancers who only know code.
I am trying to understand the business of my clients and help them to reach their goals.
I really love to provide good suggestions and the best solutions to clients, and that's why my clients consider me as a partner than just a contractor. 
Also, I have a proactive attitude, great vision, and am responsible for my work.
For 10 years, while I'm working on web development, I have worked on hundreds of big and small web projects, and I have been matured enough to handle any type of task.

With these abilities, I have made good and long-term relationships with my clients.

I won't list all the programming skills I have because I have worked on most of the web related technics and If I do list all, it will be similar to the whole web technic list.
But if I choose a few of them that I engaged with recently, those are like below.
As a diligent and fast learner, I really love to study new trend technologies in my spare time. `,
